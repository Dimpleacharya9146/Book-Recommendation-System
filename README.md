## Code Documentation: Book Recommendation System - Data Extraction, Initial Loading, and Cosine Similarity

This document describes a Python script that handles the extraction of zipped CSV files containing book, rating, and user data, then loads the 'Books.csv' file into a Pandas DataFrame, and finally outlines the process for calculating cosine similarity for metric evaluation.

-----

### 1\. Import Libraries

The script begins by importing necessary libraries:

  * **`numpy`** as `np`: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, often used for array operations. It's crucial for the mathematical operations involved in cosine similarity.
  * **`pandas`** as `pd`: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for working with tabular data (DataFrames).
  * **`zipfile`**: Python's built-in module for working with ZIP archives.
  * **`sklearn.metrics.pairwise`**: This module from scikit-learn provides functions to compute the similarity between samples in arrays, including `cosine_similarity`.

<!-- end list -->

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import zipfile
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
```

-----

### 2\. Extract Zipped Data Files

This section handles the extraction of three zipped CSV files. Each `.zip` file is opened in read mode (`'r'`) using a `with` statement, which ensures the file is properly closed after the operation. The `extractall()` method is then used to decompress the contents of each zip file into the specified directory: `/mnt/data/`.

  * `Books.csv (1).zip`
  * `Ratings.csv (1).zip`
  * `Users.csv.zip`

<!-- end list -->

```python
with zipfile.ZipFile('Books.csv (1).zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('/mnt/data/')

with zipfile.ZipFile('Ratings.csv (1).zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('/mnt/data/')

with zipfile.ZipFile('Users.csv.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('/mnt/data/')
```

A success message is printed to the console after all files are extracted. ✅

```python
print("✅ All files extracted successfully.")
```

-----

### 3\. Load Books Data

After extraction, the **`Books.csv`** file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame named `books`. The **`encoding='latin1'`** parameter is specified to handle potential character encoding issues in the CSV file, which is common with datasets from various sources.

```python
books = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/Books.csv', encoding='latin1')
```

-----

### 4\. Data Filtering and Preprocessing (Conceptual)

Before calculating cosine similarity, **data filtering and preprocessing** are essential steps. This typically involves:

  * **Handling Missing Values**: Dealing with `NaN` (Not a Number) entries.
  * **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Choosing or creating features (e.g., genres, authors, average ratings) that will be used to represent each book as a vector.
  * **Normalization/Scaling**: Ensuring all features contribute equally to the similarity calculation.
  * **Creating a Feature Matrix**: Transforming the filtered data into a numerical matrix where rows represent books and columns represent features. This matrix is the input for cosine similarity.

*Example:* If you wanted to find similarity based on a numerical representation of genres, you might one-hot encode genres.

-----

### 5\. Cosine Similarity for Metric Evaluation

**Cosine similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. It ranges from -1 (exactly opposite) to 1 (exactly the same), with 0 indicating orthogonality (no correlation). In recommendation systems, a higher cosine similarity between two items (e.g., books) suggests they are more similar.

**Mathematical Formula:**

$$\text{similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{||\mathbf{A}|| \cdot ||\mathbf{B}||} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}}$$

Where $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are two vectors, $A\_i$ and $B\_i$ are components of vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ respectively, and $n$ is the number of dimensions.

**Python Implementation (using `sklearn`):**

This example assumes you have a `feature_matrix` (a NumPy array or Pandas DataFrame) where each row represents a book and its features.

```python
# --- This is placeholder code. You'll need to prepare your 'feature_matrix' ---
# Example: Create a dummy feature matrix for demonstration
# In a real scenario, this 'feature_matrix' would come from
# processing your 'books' DataFrame (e.g., using TfidfVectorizer on descriptions,
# or one-hot encoding categorical features, etc.).

# Let's imagine you have processed your 'books' data to create numerical features.
# For instance, if you had features like 'genre_fiction', 'genre_fantasy', 'avg_rating_scaled'
# for each book.

# For demonstration purposes, let's create a small, hypothetical feature matrix:
# Book 1: [0.8, 0.2, 0.9] (e.g., high fiction, low fantasy, high rating)
# Book 2: [0.7, 0.3, 0.8]
# Book 3: [0.1, 0.9, 0.7] (e.g., low fiction, high fantasy, medium rating)

# In a real application, 'feature_matrix' would be derived from your 'books' DataFrame
# after extensive preprocessing, e.g., using TF-IDF on book descriptions or one-hot encoding genres.
#
# For instance, if you had processed text data:
# from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
# tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
# book_descriptions_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(books['Book-Description'].fillna(''))
# feature_matrix = book_descriptions_tfidf.toarray() # Or directly use sparse matrix if preferred by cosine_similarity

# Let's use a simple numerical array for illustration:
# Assume these are numerical features derived from book data
feature_matrix = np.array([
    [0.8, 0.2, 0.9],
    [0.7, 0.3, 0.8],
    [0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    [0.75, 0.25, 0.85] # Another book similar to book 1 and 2
])

# Calculate the cosine similarity matrix
# The output will be a square matrix where element [i, j] is the
# cosine similarity between item i and item j.
cosine_sim_matrix = cosine_similarity(feature_matrix)

print("Cosine Similarity Matrix:")
print(cosine_sim_matrix)

# Example: Get similarities for the first book (index 0) with all other books
# You'd typically use this to find the top N most similar books
book_0_similarities = cosine_sim_matrix[0]
print("\nSimilarities of Book 0 with all books:")
print(book_0_similarities)

# To find recommendations, you'd usually sort these similarities
# (excluding the similarity of the book with itself, which is 1)
# and pick the top N
